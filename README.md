Third-Party Attributions
Music
- Two songs from this youtube channel/website
- According to their FAQ, for non commercial use the requirement is a link to their website.

We decided to link the FAQ as the link to the website, as that seemed the most relevant to checking to make sure out attribution is correct.

- Two more songs from this youtube channel
- This youtube channel just said no copyright free to use music.

It doesnt say anything about attribution, but since they're third-party we've linked them anyway.

ART\
We did generate a lot of art for this game with AI.\
Below is a list of all the generated art:
* The 9 enemy sprites (Assassin.png, Dire Wolf.png, Fire dragon.png, Fire Imp.png, Giant.png, Goblin.png, Grizzly Bear.png, Skeleton.png, and Zombie.png)
* The 3 area backgrounds (Area 1.png, Area 2.png, and Area 3.png)
* Player.png and player sprite.png
* The card outlines were made by Chand but the art on the card itself was generated. (27, a bit too many to list all the filenames neatly here.)
* The map (levels.png)
* The shop (gameshop.png)
* The start screen (start_screen.png)
